1. The purpose of the game is to type the words on the aliens and asteroids as fast as you can 

2. To shoot an alien, you must first unlock it by typing the word that is on the alien. 
Once you type it successfully, the word will disappear and you will be able to shoot it 

3. Asteroid will have 3 words on them, if you type all three words before the asteroid hits the ground, 
all of the current aliens will be cleared 
*note - you must hit enter after typing a word 

4. You can change the speed of the bullet by pressing 1, 2, or 3 on your keyboard. 1 is the slowest speed, 
and 3 is the fastest 

5. If you would like a parabolic shot instead of a linear one, you can pressed Shift + A (holding them both down 
together). To deactivate the parabolic shot: press Shift + A again 

6. If you shoot a falling ice cube successfully, the game will "freeze" for 5 seconds. 
In this time, you can either unlock aliens, type words on an asteroid (if present), or shoot aliens 

7. For every 3 asteroids you clear successfully, you will get a "super bullet" which is 3 times the size of a regular 
bullet. This may allow you to shoot through multiple objects at once 

8. For every 5 asteroids you clear, you will get a "ricochet" bullet, which will bounce off the side walls 
and any aliens you hit. This is indicated by an 'R' at the bottom left of your screen

9. The game will end if 10 aliens reach the ground 

10. You win the game if you clear 12 asteroids 
 
11. At the end of the game, there will be a report telling you what words you mistyped, and you will 
be able to practice them!

12. Points - Clearing an asteroid is +10, shooting an alien is +2, an unlocked alien
hitting the ground is -5, a locked alien hitting the ground is -15
