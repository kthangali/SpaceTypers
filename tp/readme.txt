DESCRIPTION 

This project is called “Space Typers.” It is based on children’s games that are meant to help kids learn how to type. In the game, there will be aliens and asteroids. Each alien will have a word, you have to unlock the alien by typing the word before you can shoot it. Asteroids will have 3 words, and the user will have the option of clearing all the aliens for a short period of time if they type the words correctly. You can win by clearing 12 asteroids, and you lose if 10 aliens fall to the ground. 

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT 

Download and unzip the "tp" folder
 
CD into the "tp" folder so that it is your working directory

Run the "modalApp.py" file

There is a text file called "players.txt" that includes encrypted player data from my plays. As you play the game, your data will be added to this file. If you would like to clear the data and start from an empty file, you can delete this file from the folder and run the game. The file will be recreated with your first play. * For the data to be saved, you must either play the game to completion or use a keyboard shortcut to hit "game over" or "win." Your data will not be saved if you simply exit out of the game *
